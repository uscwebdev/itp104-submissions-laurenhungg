Project Summary: 


In this project, I've chosen to explore the theme of my favorite people and places. The primary objective of my website is to create a platform for showcasing individuals and locations that hold significant meaning in my life. By curating content around these cherished people and places, I aim to express my deep appreciation for the relationships and experiences that have shaped my personal journey.

As additional features, I've incorporated an iframe displaying a YouTube video on the people page. This video adds a dynamic element, providing visitors with a multimedia experience and further insight into the people who have influenced me. Additionally, on the places page, I've implemented a zoom-in effect on the pictures (transitions and transformations)
